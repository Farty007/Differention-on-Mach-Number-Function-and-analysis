# Differention-on-Mach-Number-Function-and-analysis


This code is made to understand the physical/numerical methods to do differentiation in computing languages, specifically Python, and analyze it to find the better method by checking the accuracy of it all. 

This is done on the Prnadtl Meyer Function,

** Prandtl - Meyer Angle **
$$\sqrt{\dfrac{\gamma+1}{\gamma-1}}\arctan{\sqrt{\dfrac{\gamma-1}{\gamma+1}(M^2-1)}}-\arctan{\sqrt{(M^2-1)}}$$

The numerical methods used include the central, forward, and backward methods of differentiation, and the accuracy is measured against the original function differentiated by hand and inputted in the code to get the absolute correct values.
