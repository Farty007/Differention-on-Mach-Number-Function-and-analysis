# Differention-on-Mach-Number-Function-and-analysis


This code is made to understand the pyhsical methods to do differenation in computing landuages, specifically python, and do analysis on it to find the the better method by checking the accuracy of it all. 

This is done on the Prnadtl Meyer Function,

** Prandtl - Meyer Angle **
$$\left(\sqrt{(\gamma+1)/(\gamma-1)}\right$$
